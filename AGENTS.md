* The web application should be a fully runnable FastAPI project with a professional front-end located in `backend/static`.
* Styling must be polished and production ready.
* Keep code organized and readable.
* Provide clear instructions in `README.md` for how to run the application.
* Add new features in line with the specification when modifying the backend or front-end.
* Ensure the application starts with `uvicorn backend.api:app --reload` after installing dependencies from `README.md`.
